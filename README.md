# Covid-Dashboard
Here , I have made a COVID dashboard using Python(Jupyter Lab) and WHO data. 

dataset-> https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-table-data.csv


To run it locally, you must have installed packages(listed under "requirement.txt").

Just type 'panel serve ReadyDashboard.ipynb' in terminal.
